# How to checkout recent branch in git?

Use the following command to checkout recent branch:
```shell
git checkout -
```

It's basically an alias for:

```shell
git checkout @{-1}
```

You can checkout any previous branch, by replacing `N` with the N-th last branch that was checked out.

```bash
git checkout @{-N}
```

Following diagram ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/33199051)), illustrates it perfectly:

# Unidirectional and bidirectional data flow

## Unidirectional (one-way) data flow
- You pass data down from parent to child component
- You can't update parent's state from a child
	- Instead, you handle events dispatched by a child to update the state
- `Parent -> Child`

## Bidirectional (two-way) data flow
- Parent and child components share the data
	- Change to model updates the view
	- Change to view updates the model
- `Parent <-> Child`

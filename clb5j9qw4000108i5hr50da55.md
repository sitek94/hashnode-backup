# Improve your problem solving skills with Advent of Code

It's December already, so it's time for another edition of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about).

> *Advent of Code* is an [Advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar) of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in [any](https://github.com/search?q=advent+of+code) programming language you like.

I usually solve the puzzles using TypeScript/JavaScript and you can check out [my repo with solutions here](https://github.com/sitek94/advent-of-code).

Have fun and good luck!

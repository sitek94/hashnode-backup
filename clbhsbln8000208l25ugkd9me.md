# How to split string to strings of equal length in JavaScript?

**Solution**

```javascript
'abcdabcdabcdabcdabcd'.match(/.{1,4}/g)
// ['abcd', 'abcd', 'abcd', 'abcd', 'abcd']
```
Here's [original StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8359929/13504198). 

**Context**

In today's [Advent of Code challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/10), I had to simulate drawing pixels on 40x6 CRT screen. First I computed lit and dark pixels, and got the following string, which I needed to map on 40x6 screen.

```js
const screen = '##..##..##..##..##..##..##..##..##..##..###...###...###...###...###...###...###.####....####....####....####....####....#####.....#####.....#####.....#####.....######......######......######......###########.......#######.......#######.....';

const formattedScreen = screen
  .match(/.{1,40}/g)
  .join('\n');
```

After logging that in the console, I got expected output which contained 8 capital letters - the answer to the challenge: `PGHFGLUG`

```
###...##..#..#.####..##..#....#..#..##..
#..#.#..#.#..#.#....#..#.#....#..#.#..#.
#..#.#....####.###..#....#....#..#.#....
###..#.##.#..#.#....#.##.#....#..#.#.##.
#....#..#.#..#.#....#..#.#....#..#.#..#.
#.....###.#..#.#.....###.####..##...###.

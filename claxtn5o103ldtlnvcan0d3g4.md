# How to add overlay color to <img />

If you want to change the color of a remote image, that you display like this:

```html
<img alt="freeCodeCamp logo"
  src="https://unpkg.com/simple-icons@7.20.0/icons/freecodecamp.svg" 
/>
```

You can use [CSS filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter) property. It offers a variety of different color functions, which you can use to change the color of your image, like `contrast`, `hue-rotate` or `saturate`.

Of course, trying to find the correct color manually would be extremely hard. Fortunately, some smart people created tools like [this one](https://isotropic.co/tool/hex-color-to-css-filter/), where you enter a target HEX color and it gives you back a computed filter property value.

All you have to do now, is add it in your CSS:

```css
img {
  filter: 
    invert(2%) 
    sepia(82%) 
    saturate(4192%) 
    hue-rotate(242deg) 
    brightness(102%) 
    contrast(98%);
}
```

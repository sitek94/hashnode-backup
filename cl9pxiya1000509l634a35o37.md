# Who owns the JavaScript trademark?

Originally, the trademark was issued to Sun Microsystems in 1997. Then it was transferred to Oracle when they acquired Sun in 2010.

However, the trademark doesn't have any commercial value for Oracle, and they do not even participate in the development of any JavaScript engines. 

On September 3, 2022, Ryan Dahl published an [open letter to Oracle](https://tinyclouds.org/trademark), asking them to release the JavaScript trademark.

There is also an interesting thread on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32709870), not only about the topic of the trademark, but also about the history of JavaScript.

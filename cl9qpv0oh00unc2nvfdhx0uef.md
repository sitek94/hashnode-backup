# Improving writing skills by building a publishing habit

I find it pretty difficult to write articles, documentation and longer texts. It's both time-consuming and requires a lot of effort.

That's why, last week, I started writing short articles about the stuff, that I've recently learned, or anything that I think is interesting.

Basically, I'd like to improve my writing skills, so that it takes less time and is simply easier.

My first goal is to build a habit of publishing such entries a few times a week, and to boost my motivation a bit, I'm going to take part in [#2articles1week](https://hashnode.com/challenge/2articles1week) Hashnode Challenge.
